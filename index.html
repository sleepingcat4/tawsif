    <div class="about">
      <p>tawsif (call me ammar) here, I'm an artificial intelligence researcher who previously worked at <a href="http://www.harvardgami.com/" target="_blank">Harvard GAMI</a> as lead artificial intelligence researcher and <a href="https://www.donders.ru.nl/en/" target="_blank">Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour</a> as Guest researcher by being part of Prof. Lisa Genzel's lab. In the past, I led teams in Deep learning largely for small closed-door projects and a few well-known cross-institution ones.</p>
      <p>At the moment, I contribute to <a href="https://laion.ai/" target="_blank">LAION AI</a> and Open-SCI and also lead my own advanced artificial intelligence research teams which are most often in-collaboration with Israeli and European Universities and labs. I have experience in large dataset compilation, RAG and embeddings, evaluation and benchmarks, and Multi-modal training. I also worked on HPC (High-performance Computing) thanks to LAION and further wrote critical scaling mechanisms for downloading huge-flux of data from the internet. I like to think of myself as a dataset creator first and model trainer second.</p>
      <p>I'm also working on building my own lab called <strong>Sleeping AI</strong>. If you have any internship/collaboration or otherwise simply want to donate to fund some of my projects either through compute grants/resources/donation, feel free to reach out <a href="mailto:sleeping4cat@gmail.com">sleeping4cat@gmail.com</a>.</p>
